    <p>I just finished high school and currently schooling in Moringa School doing my Moringa prep</p>
    <p>I have a work experience for five months before joining Moringa which was great and life teaching</p>
    <p>Since way back i've always wanted to make my own invention that's legit which could help people in life and i loved computer hence choosing programming.Programming also secures one's job opportunities, so the other reason is also getting a job or even self-employed.</p>
